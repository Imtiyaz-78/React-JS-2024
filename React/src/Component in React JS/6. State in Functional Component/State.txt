===> What is state in react js:
     1. state is an object which is use to store or hold the data.
     2. state is a container which is use to store the data.
     3. state is like that varibale.


==> Why we use state in react instead of variable:
    when we use variable then our variable value will not be change 
    and when we use state then value will changed on every where


==> What is diff b/w state and variable:
     1. when we use noramal variable once it's assigned its value canâ€™t be changed.
     2. but when we use State then React itself manage
     3. But in ReactJS, State has the capability to update itself. So whenever you make any changes
     4. In variable we can not use this keyword.
     5. But in state we can use this keyword for access the component.


     Byself: When we use variable then component will not be re-render 
             and when we use state then component will be re-rendered.
